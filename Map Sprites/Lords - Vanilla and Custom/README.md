### LT Fixes by JaidynReiman

These are minor fixes to allow them to be imported into LT. Most common reason is they need to be cropped out. For example, some walk sheets are 8 pixels too tall.

- Blade Lord (F) Sword

### Elf Eirika by JaidynReiman
- This was originally made in my Legacy assets and was edited directly off of OG Eirika's sprite.
- This is designed for Amaya.

### Mage Lord Elf by JaidynReiman
- Mage Lord by TyTheBub
- This is a super minor edit to add elf-style ears. I'll probably do a more advanced edit later.
