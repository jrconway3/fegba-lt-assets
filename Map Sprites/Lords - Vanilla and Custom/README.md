## Credits

I'll be including a lot of "fix for LT" assets here. These are simply redone for LT to support the ability to import them into Lex Talionis.

Assets from the FE-Repo can be imported into FEGBA fine but fail importing into LT. The most common reason is due to height differences. This particular issue has been fixed, as now 488 px tall walk sprites can be imported. However, I will still include other minor fixes I have made in this repository.

I may make fixes for palettes where needed as well, so when imported in LT it will properly generate gray variants.

None at this time, more to come.


#### Legacy Map Sprites

These map sprites were made by me when I was looking into potentially doing Fire Emblem XP over a decade ago. That project was abandoned, but I still had these assets lying around.

I have only kept the ones with notable changes. I haven't yet adapted these for FEGBA or Lex Talionis, but eventually I would like to.

- Female Berserker
    - Female Berserker already exists now, but this was a simple edit to add a chest band for obvious reasons.
- Dark Mage w/Bangs
    - For an OC named Trent. Some exist like this, but this exact design does not.
- Hatless Mage?
    - I can't remember the exact purpose, but I assume it was removing the hat. Probably not that special given this already exists.
- Demon Swordmaster
    - I was working on fully repaletting this one but never finished. The sprite has horns in addition to a (partially converted) black kimono.
- Headbandless Female Thief
    - I actually really like this one, it looks pretty unique.
    - For an OC called Melody. While she won't be using this sprite I still like the design. Its not like other long-haired thief sprites such as Legault.
- Female Assassin
    - Honestly doesn't look very good, probably not worth porting over.
- Pegasus Staff
    - I suspect this does exist, but I'll compare it anyway and see if its worth porting.
- Peg Leg Pirate
    - This character was created as a joke mostly. I do like the Peg Leg though and may port it over.
- Sword Cavalier
    - Is a lie, because I don't see a sword there. I'll compare it to other sprites but I doubt this is anything interesting.
- Hat Archer
    - Archer with a hat. Based on a rough concept I did a while back.


### Elf Eirika by JaidynReiman
- This was originally made in my Legacy assets and was edited directly off of OG Eirika's sprite.
- This is designed for Amaya.


### Mage Lord Elf by JaidynReiman
- Mage Lord by TyTheBub
- This is a super minor edit to add elf-style ears. I'll probably do a more advanced edit later.
