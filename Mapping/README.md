### Tilesets

I'll include all my maps and autotiles I have created here.

I don't really do Tilesets, but I have included some fixes in here to make tilesets easier to import into Lex Talionis. Most tilesets in the FE Graphics Repository only include the FEGBA palettes, but they don't have the tilesheet with the repals in place. I have made many of these myself with help from BWDYeti's FBAFE Tileset Viewer.

In addition, any "remaster" or "remake" tilesets often change the water. As such, new autotiles need to be made. I have made some Autotiles here and plan to make more in the future.


#### Maps

I have included all the maps I have made so far. Some of these are WIP's.

- Roam: Oestridel City
    - Tileset: Cynon's Metropolis 0.80
        - Made by: {Cynon}
        - Palette: Default
- Roam: Oestridel Cathedral
    - Tileset: FE8 Castle + Customs - Improved Tileset
        - Made by: {N426}
        - Palette: Purple Carpet
    - Tileset: Cynon's Metropolis 0.80
        - Made by: {Cynon}
        - Palette: Default
        - NOTE: Only the exterior portion of the second version of this map has it. This wouldn't work in FE Builder, but it does work in LT Maker.
    - This is inside the large cathedral in the town. The idea is that region events at the edge of the cathedral let you walk into it.
    - Because there's no "pews" or "chairs" in castle maps, I settled on the idea of having bookshelves and water.
    - The rough idea here is that the sanctuary is on the second floor and won't be accessible.
- Prologue (Ch0): Lady of Oestridel
    - Tileset: Cynon's Metropolis 0.80
        - Made by: {Cynon}
        - Palette: Default
    - This is merely a subset of Oestridel City. Also, this is an early version of it; the final version is a much smaller square.
- Chapter 5
    - Tileset: - FE8 - Fields - Remaster - Super Fields
        - Made by: {WAve, RandomWizard, Beast}
        - Palette: Aquamarine Roofs + Gray Mountains
    - May change the palette later, but this is what I decided for now.
    - This is the forest just outside of the Chapter 6 map. In my original plan this was going to be after that map instead of before.
- Chapter 6
    - Village - Remake + Coconut Tree + Ship Extras - Tileset
        - Made by: {flasuban, N426, ZoramineFae, Venno}
        - Palette: Default
    - Originally was the Prologue, but I decided to set the Prologue much further back in time.
    - As such, this will not encompass the whole village, but it also means the village needs to be redesigned to work better as a proper battle map.
    - Originally I used Village Remake with Ship Extras because I wanted the ship here, but I don't need the ship in this particular map. So its possible I may swap it for a different tileset later, but I haven't decided yet.
- Chapter 8
    - Tileset: - FE8 - Fields - Remaster - Super Fields
        - Made by: {WAve, RandomWizard, Beast}
        - Palette: Dark Water, Pink Mountains
        - NOTE: I'm heavily considering recreating this using a mountain tileset or perhaps Frontier Remake. I think it might look better.
    - This map was originally the next map after Chapter 6, but now there's an extra gap map.
    - The map is in the mountains northwest of the Chapter 6 map. The southeast corner is the starting position.


#### Palettes

These palettes were made by the original artists for FEGBA, the only thing I have done here is apply the palette to the tileset so it can be more easily used in Lex Talionis Engine.

Credits to BWDYeti for FBAFE Tileset Viewer which helped me to create these finished tilesets.

- Towns / Villages / Cities
    - Cynon's Metropolis

        - I dropped in a Purple palette for 0.83 to coincide with the 0.94 Purple palette.

#### Autotiles

- Cynon's Metropolis by Cynon
- Cynon's Metropolis Autotiles by JaidynReiman
    - After seeing Cynon's Metropolis I thought it would be perfect for a big city. I felt that the village tilesets just didn't work quite as well. As such, I reached out to Cynon to confirm if I could make autotiles for it and Cynon was happy to oblige, so I made a full sheet of Autotiles for 0.83. I haven't yet finished Autotiles on 0.90.
