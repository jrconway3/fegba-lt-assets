### Icons

Due to the way Lex Talionis handles icons its not really efficient to load in icons one at a time, its really designed to work with sheets. As such, I went ahead and compiled a bunch of sheets from the FE Repo.

In all cases I tried my best to ensure only one artist is on each sheet, with a couple of exceptions. The only notable exception is the Weapon Rank sheet, as I did this early on and thought it'd make more sense to keep these together.

I intend on adding more and also adding new icons to these sheets over time.


#### Custom Icon Sheets

These are custom icon sheets I compiled for containing all icons one artist made. In some cases, I broke them down based on icon type.

- 2WB
    - All Monster Icons
    - All Tome Icons
- Alice - All Icons
- Artist Unknown - All Tomes
- AtelierLabs - All Icons
- Batima
    - All Monster Icons
    - All Tomes
- Beansy
    - All Monster Icons
    - All Tomes
- Ereshkigal
    - All Tomes
    - All Weapons
        - This one needs more cleanup.
- Kyrads - All Tomes
- Lisandra Brave - All Tomes
- Peerless - All Icons
- Topazlight - All Icons
- VelvetKistune - All Icons
- Zarg
    - All Monster Icons
    - All Tomes
    - Recommended to use the Edited sheet for Zarg instead.
- Alice, RLC, VelvetKitsune, JaidynReiman, Stephano
    - Expanded Weapon Icons
    - I originally made this sheet with all icon types, but I feel like I want to get rid of this one later. I'd much rather keep these kinds of sheets separate by artist if at all possible. As I expand these sheets more I will likely get rid of this sheet and replace it with only icons I created myself.

#### Editing / Cleaned Icon Sheets

These are pre-existing Icon Sheets in the FE Repo that had to be cleaned up in order to use in LT. These sheets are not designed to have exact pixel squares, and as such, there's often big gaps and borders around certain sections. I simply edited these assets to clean them up and make them usable for LT.

- EldritchA, Indogutsu Tenbuki
    - Tactics Ogre All Icons
- Ereshkigal
    - All Icons 1.3
    - I was going to use this one, then I realized the tomes here are significantly lacking compared to the full sheet I made.
- ThunderMage
    - Vanilla Tome Edits + Customs
    - I made a few small updates here. I noticed that the tomes with borders were a bit inconsistent so I ensured every tome cover had both red and blue borders.
- Zane
    - All Icons
    - This combines all of Zane's sheets and makes sure any stray icons are also present.
- Zarg
    - All Icons
    - This combines all of Zarg's sheets and stray individual icons.
- ZessDynamite, Rainlsash, LordGlenn, Suneohair
    - Complete Skill Icon Sheet
    - This sheet was shared in the LT Discord. Its more complete than the one in the FE-Repo.
    - I'm only sharing it here because I made a few small additions. I added +7 and +10 icons (and -7 and -10) to all main statistic icons towards the top.
