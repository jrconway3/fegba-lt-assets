All Portraits have been made by me without splices, as such, they're not necessarily the best.

My initial portraits started from AI generated portraits, then I retraced and reshaded them by hand to try and replicate the original design. From there, though, I started working on adding my own new additions to greatly expand and alter them.

All of my characters are of high fantasy races, with very few being insdistinguishable from real life humans or classical elves. As such, I have included generic elf or human variants of all my characters so people who want to use these portraits in standard games can do so, though I can't say I'm exactly happy with the ones I have so far.

The following characters I have portraits for so far:

- Princess Shayala Massione
    - This one was a complete accident. I was using Klokgen to come up with designs and I came up with a really nice design that suited her well.
    - When I traced the portrait, I tried to encompass her entire upper torso. Upon sharing it in the FE Graphics Repo this "style" was really well liked there. I have decided I want to use this "Bust" design for all my future character portraits.
    - Shayala is a Lykon, which are wolf-like elves. They have wolf-like tails and ears on the sides of their heads and can run on all fours.
    - Originally Shayala was not intended to be a Lykon, but merely descent from them. However, upon delving into the lore I realized this just didn't make any sense, so I fixed that issue and made her a Lykon as well as most of the population of her Kingdom.
- Svetlanya Renald
    - Her name was originally Miriam. After seeing just HOW OFTEN the name Miriam is used in everything, I finally reluctantly decided to change her name. Not only have I seen Miriam in another FE romhack, but I also saw it in Unicorn Overlord, which is what really killed the idea of using the name.
    - Svetlana means "Light" which is why I went with that name. I thought it was kinda cute mixing Svetlana with "anya".
    - Svetlanya is the main protagonist. Originally she was a supporting character to Relm, but when coming up with the idea for an FE fangame, I opted to instead make it a prequel with Svetlanya being the protagonist.
    - Svetlanya is a "Queiza", that being my take on Merfolk to a limited extent. Its more like a "water elf" where they have legs and fins, as well as a fin tail. I tried to give her ears somewhat of a finlike appearance in her earlier designs, but in her latest design I changed it up a bit. There's a reason for this, but I'll get to that idea later.
    - Unfortunately I can't say she resembles the concept very well. I'm holding off on designing her until I can have an artist help me fully finish her design.
    - I started working on a Bust-style design for her, but I haven't finished it yet.
- Amaya Lyudam
    - Amaya is a former noblewoman and Svetlanya's new retainer.
    - I went through several variations of her, with some being Amaya already having known Svetlanya for some time. In the final draft, however, Amaya is only just being assigned to Svetlanya.
    - She is related to the Queiza, but is "degraded", which means she's lost her Queizan attributes. She cannot swim nor breath underwater, but she's still expected to follow Svetlanya wherever she goes...
    - Amaya is one of my oldest characters. Her name was originally just Maya, but after seeing just how many characters I had starting with the letter M I renamed her to "Amaya."
    - I am completely unhappy with the designs here. I already have a final design for her anyway, so I'm just going to go back to that design when I work on a bust style portrait for her. She may be the second one I complete, because she and Shayala have finalized designs while Svetlanya does not.
