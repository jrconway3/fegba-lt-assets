### Portraits

All Portraits have been made by me without splices, as such, they're not necessarily the best.

My initial portraits started from AI generated portraits, then I retraced and reshaded them by hand to try and replicate the original design. From there, though, I started working on adding my own new additions to greatly expand and alter them.

All of my characters are of high fantasy races, with very few being insdistinguishable from real life humans or classical elves. As such, I have included some generic elf or human variants of my characters so people who want to use these portraits in standard games can do so.

The following characters I have portraits for so far:

* Princess Shayala Massione

  * This one was a complete accident. I was using Klokgen to come up with designs and I came up with a really nice design that suited her well.
  * When I traced the portrait, I tried to encompass her entire upper torso. Upon sharing it in the FE Graphics Repo this "style" was really well liked there. I have decided I want to use this "Bust" design for all my future character portraits.
  * Shayala is a Lykon, which are wolf-like elves. Her ears are furry on purpose. She has a tail but its not visible.

* Svetlanya Renald

  * Her name was originally Miriam. After seeing just HOW OFTEN the name Miriam is used in everything, I finally reluctantly decided to change her name. Not only have I seen Miriam in another FE romhack, but I also saw it in Unicorn Overlord, which is what really killed the idea of using the name.
  * Svetlanya is the main protagonist. Originally she was a supporting character to Relm, but when coming up with the idea for an FE fangame, I opted to instead make it a prequel with Svetlanya being the protagonist.
  * Svetlanya is a "Queiza", that being my take on Merfolk to a limited extent. Its more like a "water elf" where they have legs and fins, as well as a fin tail. Her ears are designed to reflect that.
  * Her "bust" pose has her complete final design. She has a more pink skintone (the skintone pulled from her original artwork) as well as a natural skintone from Blade's Skin Tones sheet. The pink version is intended to be her final design.

* Amaya Lyudam

  * Amaya is a former noblewoman and Svetlanya's new retainer.
  * I went through several variations of her, with some being Amaya already having known Svetlanya for some time. In the final draft, however, Amaya is only just being assigned to Svetlanya.
  * She is related to the Queiza, but is "degraded", which means she's lost her Queizan attributes. She cannot swim nor breath underwater, but she's still expected to follow Svetlanya wherever she goes...
  * Amaya is one of my oldest characters. Her name was originally just Maya, but after seeing just how many characters I had starting with the letter M I renamed her to "Amaya."
  * I was completely unhappy with the older portrait designs, I could never get the hair right. These designs will still be available to use.
  * The new bust-style design is a combination of the modern design drawn by my commission artist as well as her older armor design. The final portrait turned out very well IMO.

* Relm Kisaragi

  * Relm is the original main protagonist of the series.
  * When writing this story, I came up with the idea of it being a prequel. As such, Relm is now a teenager when normally she's a young woman.
  * Relm has many variant designs but I was aiming for a forlorn, sad expression on her face.
  * The Kimono is her intended final "main" outfit. Her starting design is intended to be a more messy look because she's been on the run for a long time.


Minor Characters:

* Frida Scenack

  * Frida was created to be a generic cleric, and her design is the intended "basic" design for generic clerics. She's a minor optional playable character now.
  * I originally created her to simply be a random cleric who speaks to Svetlanya in the opening. I had fun generating ideas for a cute Lykon cleric so I commissioned her design.
  * She is the wife of Urso. They're a young Lykon couple. The intent behind them is you can recruit either Frida or Urso initially, only able to recruit both of them later.
