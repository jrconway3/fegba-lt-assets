### Portraits

All Portraits have been made by me without splices, as such, they're not necessarily the best.

My initial portraits started from AI generated portraits, then I retraced and reshaded them by hand to try and replicate the original design. From there, though, I started working on adding my own new additions to greatly expand and alter them.

For my "bust-style" portraits, which include the extended torso, the only one based on AI art to begin with was Shayala. Her initial portrait was just a direct trace of the AI art. All other bust-style portraits were modified from this initial base design where I redrew the torso from scratch, then each indivdiual article of clothing and hair.

All of my characters are of high fantasy races, with very few being insdistinguishable from real life humans or classical elves. As such, I have included some generic elf or human variants of my characters so people who want to use these portraits in standard games can do so.

The following characters I have portraits for so far:

1. Main Characters:

    * Svetlanya Renald

        * Svetlanya Final
            * This is in the "bust style", which includes a bit more of the torso compared to standard FE portraits.
            * Svetlanya is a Lanquiz or "water dragon" / "water elf".
        * Svetlanya WIP V1 / V2:
            * V1 includes "elf" and "human" variants.
            * These were traces of AI art that were the closest idea I had to my original idea for her design. No parts of the AI art were used in the final, this was simply a trace / recreation. I still did all the shading myself.
            * These are abandoned concepts, but you can use them if you want for splices or anything else.
        * Svetlanya the character belongs to me, but the portraits are F2E. You can use them, modify them or splice parts from them if you wish.

    * Amaya Lyudam

        * Amaya Final
            * This is in the "bust style", which includes a bit more of the torso compared to standard FE portraits.
        * Amaya WIP V1
            * V1 includes "elf" and "human" variants.
            * These were traces of AI art that were the closest idea I had to my original idea for her design. No parts of the AI art were used in the final, this was simply a trace / recreation. I still did all the shading myself.
            * These are abandoned concepts, but you can use them if you want for splices or anything else. I couldn't ever get Amaya to look good enough so I scrapped it.
        * Amaya the character belongs to me, but the portraits are F2E. You can use them, modify them or splice parts from them if you wish.

    * Relm Kisaragi

        * Relm Ponytail
            * This is Relm's main version, including a kimono.
        * Relm Hooded
            * The "Clip Hooded" version is the final version. The non-clip version is an older idea, but you can still use it if you wish.
            * The "Hood Down" version shows off her horns. She is a Nordak, which is my version of dragons.
        * Relm the character belongs to me, but the portraits are F2E. You can use them, modify them or splice parts from them if you wish.


2. Major Characters:

    * Princess Shayala Massione

        * This one was a complete accident. I was using Klokgen to come up with designs and I came up with a really nice design that suited her well.
        * When I traced the portrait, I tried to encompass her entire upper torso. Upon sharing it in the FE Graphics Repo this "style" was really well liked there. I have decided I want to use this "Bust" design for all my future character portraits.
        * Shayala is a Lykon, which are wolf-like elves. Her ears are furry on purpose. She has a tail but its not visible.
        * Shayala the character belongs to me, but the portraits are F2E. You can use them, modify them or splice parts from them if you wish.

    * Sister Kasuto

        * Includes both hooded and unhooded variants. She's a priestess and is similar in role to a cleric.
        * Kasuto the character belongs to me, but the portraits are F2E. You can use them, modify them or splice parts from them if you wish.

    * Yarda

        * Yarda's outfit design was inspired by a Sari. Her people's origins are intended to be inspired by Middle Eastern nations (India, Egypt, etc).
        * Her race is Zabos, which have feline characteristics.
        * Yarda the character belongs to me, but the portraits are F2E. You can use them, modify them or splice parts from them if you wish.

3. Minor Characters:

    * Frida Scenack

        * Frida was created to be a generic cleric, and her design is the intended "basic" design for generic clerics.
        * Frida the character belongs to me, but the portraits are F2E. You can use them, modify them or splice parts from them if you wish.
