# JaidynReiman's FEGBA Assets Database

The purpose of this repository is to share assets related to FEGBA and Lex Talionis that don't otherwise fit elsewhere, as well as to compile any updates/fixes I did myself. I will try and add these to the FE Graphics Repository where possible, but not everything fits there. However, even for things I do add there, I'll keep them here as well to display a distinction of what assets I specifically worked on.


The structure of this repository is designed to be similar to the FE Graphics Repository for easier viewing:
https://github.com/Klokinator/FE-Repo


I may provide some assets if they are not otherwise easily accessible but I will carefully cite in those cases how much, if any, involvement I had in them.


## Licensing

F2U/F2E

All assets I make or edit are F2U/F2E (free to use, free to edit). Keep in mind however that unless an asset is fully custom, if its based on OG Fire Emblem assets ultimately it is derivative of work done by Intelligent Systems. I am not associated with Intelligent Systems or Nintendo.

If I made an edit to an asset that wasn't F2E please let me know, but I have done my best to try and source the original assets and make sure I don't touch assets that are F2U but not F2E.


If I make any fully custom/original assets, they will be F2U/F2E but also released under the OGA-BY 3.0 license and be released on opengameart.org. I will specify when this happens.


## Assets

### Battle Animations

Battle Animation edits/repals are something I started a long time ago but didn't touch in a while. I have a number of legacy Battle Animation updates that never got fully fitted into the FEGBA style, but I have included them in this repository as an extra bonus. I may at some point get them working in FEGBA or LT, but not all of these are particularly good as they are rather outdated.


#### Legacy Battle Animations

These are old battle animations / repals originally designed for Fire Emblem XP. They are not edited properly to work in FEGBA (many of them likely use too many colors), but they might work in LT if mapped properly. However, it would be a lot of work to do so.

A handful of these might be useful, but many have been far superceded by far better modern animations in the FE-Repo. Still, these assets are fully F2E if anyone wants to work with editing them. I will probably convert some of them over and modify them further.


#### Battle Animation Reskins

This contains my more recent Battle Animation repals and reskins.

##### Wolf Knight

- Original Wolf Knight by VelvetKitsune
- Weaponless by JaidynReiman
    - The first step for me in doing a new weapon is completely removing the old weapon and filling in the gaps. So I start by erasing the weapon and filling in the gaps wherever possible. For me I also keep the layers separated to make it easier to edit again later.
- Bow by JaidynReiman
    - I was interested in having a Bow animation for Wolf Knight so I created this edit. It as also sort of an experiment to figure out my limits in what I can do with battle animations.
- Long Hair by JaidynReiman
    - I wanted a long hair version as I tend to really like long hair. Because the character is leaning forward a bit in many frames I have the long hair in both the front and back a bit, but I adjusted it in some places to make it cleaner.
- Lykon by JaidynReiman
    - I started making a Lykon version of the Wolf Knight, but I haven't finished this yet. Eventually I want to get back to it. Lykon may hint at what it is, but its my take on a humanoid race with canine-like attributes.

##### Wolf Knight Revamp

- Original Wolf / Wolf Knight by VelvetKitsune
- Wolf Knight Revamp by DATonDemand
- Weaponless by JaidynReiman
    - I started working on adding Bow to DAT's Wolf Knight Revamp, but got sidetracked with other things and never got back to it. In this case I wanted to make a fully custom Bow unlike my first attempt, but that fell apart, so perhaps when I get back to it I'll change my strategy.


##### Myrmidon
- Original Myrmidon by IS
- Tailed Myrmidon by Seliost1
- Tailed Female Myrmidon by JaidynReiman
    - Added a wolf tail to the Female Myrmidon based on Seliost1's.
    - Eventually I plan to make a full Lykon variant.


#### Battle Animation Touchups

Super minor fixes for battle animations, mostlikely to fix it for Lex Talionis.

##### Cavalier by SALVAGED

- Cavalier custom by SALVAGED.
    - This is an upgraded version of the original SALVAGED cavalier.
- Female Version by CelestiaHeart.
- Minor fix for Lex Talionis by JaidynReiman
    - Replaced the black background with the standard green.
    - Before it would import into LT with a black square around the sprite.


### Map Sprites




### Tilesets

I don't really do Tilesets, but I have included some fixes in here to make tilesets easier to import into Lex Talionis. Most tilesets in the FE Graphics Repository only include the FEGBA palettes, but they don't have the tilesheet with the repals in place. I have made many of these myself.

In addition, any "remaster" or "remake" tilesets often change the water. As such, new autotiles need to be made. I have made some Autotiles here and plan to make more in the future.

#### Palettes

- Cynon's Metropolis by Cynon
    - I quickly dropped in a Purple palette for 0.83 to coincide with the 0.90 Purple palette. This palette already existed but there's no Preview tileset for 0.83 containing Purple in the main Repo.


#### Autotiles

- Cynon's Metropolis by Cynon
- Cynon's Metropolis Autotiles by JaidynReiman
    - After seeing Cynon's Metropolis I thought it would be perfect for a big city. I felt that the village tilesets just didn't work quite as well. As such, I reached out to Cynon to confirm if I could make autotiles for it and Cynon was happy to oblige, so I made a full sheet of Autotiles for 0.83. I haven't yet finished Autotiles on 0.90.
