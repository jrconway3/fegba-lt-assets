# JaidynReiman's Fire Emblem GBA & Assets Database

The purpose of this repository is to share assets related to FEGBA and Lex Talionis that don't otherwise fit elsewhere, as well as to compile any updates/fixes I did myself. I will try and add these to the FE Graphics Repository where possible, but not everything fits there. However, even for things I do add there, I'll keep them here as well to display a distinction of what assets I specifically worked on.


The structure of this repository is designed to be similar to the FE Graphics Repository for easier viewing:
https://github.com/Klokinator/FE-Repo


I may provide some assets if they are not otherwise easily accessible but I will carefully cite in those cases how much, if any, involvement I had in them.


## Licensing

F2U/F2E

All assets I make or edit are F2U/F2E (free to use, free to edit). Keep in mind however that unless an asset is fully custom, if its based on OG Fire Emblem assets ultimately it is derivative of work done by Intelligent Systems. I am not associated with Intelligent Systems or Nintendo.

If I made an edit to an asset that wasn't F2E please let me know, but I have done my best to try and source the original assets and make sure I don't touch assets that are F2U but not F2E.


If I make any fully custom/original assets, they will be F2U/F2E but also released under the OGA-BY 3.0 license and be released on opengameart.org. I will specify when this happens.


## Assets

### Icons

Due to the way Lex Talionis handles icons its not really efficient to load in icons one at a time, its really designed to work with sheets. As such, I went ahead and compiled a bunch of sheets from the FE Repo.

In all cases I tried my best to ensure only one artist is on each sheet, with a couple of exceptions. The only notable exception is the Weapon Rank sheet, as I did this early on and thought it'd make more sense to keep these together.

I intend on adding more and also adding new icons to these sheets over time.

#### Custom Icon Sheets

These are custom icon sheets I compiled for containing all icons one artist made. In some cases, I broke them down based on icon type.

- 2WB
    - All Monster Icons
    - All Tome Icons
- Alice - All Icons
- Artist Unknown - All Tomes
- AtelierLabs - All Icons
- Batima
    - All Monster Icons
    - All Tomes
- Beansy
    - All Monster Icons
    - All Tomes
- Ereshkigal
    - All Tomes
    - All Weapons
        - This one needs more cleanup.
- Kyrads - All Tomes
- Lisandra Brave - All Tomes
- Peerless - All Icons
- Topazlight - All Icons
- VelvetKistune - All Icons
- Zarg
    - All Monster Icons
    - All Tomes
    - Recommended to use the Edited sheet for Zarg instead.
- Alice, RLC, VelvetKitsune, JaidynReiman, Stephano
    - Expanded Weapon Icons
    - I originally made this sheet with all icon types, but I feel like I want to get rid of this one later. I'd much rather keep these kinds of sheets separate by artist if at all possible. As I expand these sheets more I will likely get rid of this sheet and replace it with only icons I created myself.

#### Editing / Cleaned Icon Sheets

These are pre-existing Icon Sheets in the FE Repo that had to be cleaned up in order to use in LT. These sheets are not designed to have exact pixel squares, and as such, there's often big gaps and borders around certain sections. I simply edited these assets to clean them up and make them usable for LT.

- EldritchA, Indogutsu Tenbuki
    - Tactics Ogre All Icons
- Ereshkigal
    - All Icons 1.3
    - I was going to use this one, then I realized the tomes here are significantly lacking compared to the full sheet I made.
- ThunderMage
    - Vanilla Tome Edits + Customs
    - I made a few small updates here. I noticed that the tomes with borders were a bit inconsistent so I ensured every tome cover had both red and blue borders.
- Zane
    - All Icons
    - This combines all of Zane's sheets and makes sure any stray icons are also present.
- Zarg
    - All Icons
    - This combines all of Zarg's sheets and stray individual icons.
- ZessDynamite, Rainlsash, LordGlenn, Suneohair
    - Complete Skill Icon Sheet
    - This sheet was shared in the LT Discord. Its more complete than the one in the FE-Repo.
    - I'm only sharing it here because I made a few small additions. I added +7 and +10 icons (and -7 and -10) to all main statistic icons towards the top.


### Battle Animations

Battle Animation edits/repals are something I started a long time ago but didn't touch in a while. I have a number of legacy Battle Animation updates that never got fully fitted into the FEGBA style, but I have included them in this repository as an extra bonus. I may at some point get them working in FEGBA or LT, but not all of these are particularly good as they are rather outdated.


#### Legacy Battle Animations

These are old battle animations / repals originally designed for Fire Emblem XP. They are not edited properly to work in FEGBA (many of them likely use too many colors), but they might work in LT if mapped properly. However, it would be a lot of work to do so.

A handful of these might be useful, but many have been far superceded by far better modern animations in the FE-Repo. Still, these assets are fully F2E if anyone wants to work with editing them. I will probably convert some of them over and modify them further.


#### Battle Animation Reskins

This contains my more recent Battle Animation repals and reskins.

##### Wolf Knight

- Original Wolf Knight by VelvetKitsune
- Weaponless by JaidynReiman
    - The first step for me in doing a new weapon is completely removing the old weapon and filling in the gaps. So I start by erasing the weapon and filling in the gaps wherever possible. For me I also keep the layers separated to make it easier to edit again later.
- Bow by JaidynReiman
    - I was interested in having a Bow animation for Wolf Knight so I created this edit. It as also sort of an experiment to figure out my limits in what I can do with battle animations.
- Long Hair by JaidynReiman
    - I wanted a long hair version as I tend to really like long hair. Because the character is leaning forward a bit in many frames I have the long hair in both the front and back a bit, but I adjusted it in some places to make it cleaner.
- Lykon by JaidynReiman
    - I started making a Lykon version of the Wolf Knight, but I haven't finished this yet. Eventually I want to get back to it. Lykon may hint at what it is, but its my take on a humanoid race with canine-like attributes.

##### Wolf Knight Revamp

- Original Wolf / Wolf Knight by VelvetKitsune
- Wolf Knight Revamp by DATonDemand
- Weaponless by JaidynReiman
    - I started working on adding Bow to DAT's Wolf Knight Revamp, but got sidetracked with other things and never got back to it. In this case I wanted to make a fully custom Bow unlike my first attempt, but that fell apart, so perhaps when I get back to it I'll change my strategy.


##### Myrmidon
- Original Myrmidon by IS
- Tailed Myrmidon by Seliost1
- Tailed Female Myrmidon by JaidynReiman
    - Added a wolf tail to the Female Myrmidon based on Seliost1's.
    - Eventually I plan to make a full Lykon variant.


#### Battle Animation Touchups

Super minor fixes for battle animations, mostlikely to fix it for Lex Talionis.

##### Cavalier by SALVAGED

- Cavalier custom by SALVAGED.
    - This is an upgraded version of the original SALVAGED cavalier.
- Female Version by CelestiaHeart.
- Minor fix for Lex Talionis by JaidynReiman
    - Replaced the black background with the standard green.
    - Before it would import into LT with a black square around the sprite.


### Map Sprites

I'll be including a lot of "fix for LT" assets here. These are simply redone for LT to support the ability to import them into Lex Talionis.

Assets from the FE-Repo can be imported into FEGBA fine but fail importing into LT. The most common reason is due to height differences. This particular issue has been fixed, as now 488 px tall walk sprites can be imported. However, I will still include other minor fixes I have made in this repository.

I may make fixes for palettes where needed as well, so when imported in LT it will properly generate gray variants.


#### Legacy Map Sprites

These map sprites were made by me when I was looking into potentially doing Fire Emblem XP over a decade ago. That project was abandoned, but I still had these assets lying around.

I have only kept the ones with notable changes. I haven't yet adapted these for FEGBA or Lex Talionis, but eventually I would like to.

- Female Berserker
    - Female Berserker already exists now, but this was a simple edit to add a chest band for obvious reasons.
- Dark Mage w/Bangs
    - For an OC named Trent. Some exist like this, but this exact design does not.
- Hatless Mage?
    - I can't remember the exact purpose, but I assume it was removing the hat. Probably not that special given this already exists.
- Demon Swordmaster
    - I was working on fully repaletting this one but never finished. The sprite has horns in addition to a (partially converted) black kimono.
- Headbandless Female Thief
    - I actually really like this one, it looks pretty unique.
    - For an OC called Melody. While she won't be using this sprite I still like the design. Its not like other long-haired thief sprites such as Legault.
- Female Assassin
    - Honestly doesn't look very good, probably not worth porting over.
- Pegasus Staff
    - I suspect this does exist, but I'll compare it anyway and see if its worth porting.
- Peg Leg Pirate
    - This character was created as a joke mostly. I do like the Peg Leg though and may port it over.
- Sword Cavalier
    - Is a lie, because I don't see a sword there. I'll compare it to other sprites but I doubt this is anything interesting.
- Hat Archer
    - Archer with a hat. Based on a rough concept I did a while back.


#### Lords - Vanilla and Custom

- Elf Eirika by JaidynReiman
    - This was originally made in my Legacy assets.
    - This is designed for Amaya.
- Mage Lord Elf by JaidynReiman
    - Mage Lord by TyTheBub
    - This is a super minor edit to add elf-style ears. I'll probably do a more advanced edit later.

#### Bards, Dancers, Suppliers, Misc.

- Dancers
    - Larum, Ninian by IS.
    - Tethys by CirclesEverywhere, IS.
    - Muse / Gypsy by Alexplode
    - Larum Long Hair by Momo
    - Male Dancer by L95
    - Cleaned up to be importable into LT by JaidynReiman
    - Dance Anim Sheets by JaidynReiman

#### Mounted - Dismounted, Monsters, Misc

- Wolf Knight by JaidynReiman
    - Spliced From Wolf and Nomad
    - Wolf by VelvetKitsune
    - Nomad by Leif


### Mapping

I'll include all my maps and autotiles I have created here.

I don't really do Tilesets, but I have included some fixes in here to make tilesets easier to import into Lex Talionis. Most tilesets in the FE Graphics Repository only include the FEGBA palettes, but they don't have the tilesheet with the repals in place. I have made many of these myself with help from BWDYeti's FBAFE Tileset Viewer.

In addition, any "remaster" or "remake" tilesets often change the water. As such, new autotiles need to be made. I have made some Autotiles here and plan to make more in the future.


#### Maps

I have included all the maps I have made so far. Some of these are WIP's.

- Roam: Oestridel City
    - Tileset: Cynon's Metropolis 0.80
        - Made by: {Cynon}
        - Palette: Default
- Roam: Oestridel Cathedral
    - Tileset: FE8 Castle + Customs - Improved Tileset
        - Made by: {N426}
        - Palette: Purple Carpet
    - Tileset: Cynon's Metropolis 0.80
        - Made by: {Cynon}
        - Palette: Default
        - NOTE: Only the exterior portion of the second version of this map has it. This wouldn't work in FE Builder, but it does work in LT Maker.
    - This is inside the large cathedral in the town. The idea is that region events at the edge of the cathedral let you walk into it.
    - Because there's no "pews" or "chairs" in castle maps, I settled on the idea of having bookshelves and water.
    - The rough idea here is that the sanctuary is on the second floor and won't be accessible.
- Prologue (Ch0): Lady of Oestridel
    - Tileset: Cynon's Metropolis 0.80
        - Made by: {Cynon}
        - Palette: Default
    - This is merely a subset of Oestridel City. Also, this is an early version of it; the final version is a much smaller square.
- Chapter 5
    - Tileset: - FE8 - Fields - Remaster - Super Fields
        - Made by: {WAve, RandomWizard, Beast}
        - Palette: Aquamarine Roofs + Gray Mountains
    - May change the palette later, but this is what I decided for now.
    - This is the forest just outside of the Chapter 6 map. In my original plan this was going to be after that map instead of before.
- Chapter 6
    - Village - Remake + Coconut Tree + Ship Extras - Tileset
        - Made by: {flasuban, N426, ZoramineFae, Venno}
        - Palette: Default
    - Originally was the Prologue, but I decided to set the Prologue much further back in time.
    - As such, this will not encompass the whole village, but it also means the village needs to be redesigned to work better as a proper battle map.
    - Originally I used Village Remake with Ship Extras because I wanted the ship here, but I don't need the ship in this particular map. So its possible I may swap it for a different tileset later, but I haven't decided yet.
- Chapter 8
    - Tileset: - FE8 - Fields - Remaster - Super Fields
        - Made by: {WAve, RandomWizard, Beast}
        - Palette: Dark Water, Pink Mountains
        - NOTE: I'm heavily considering recreating this using a mountain tileset or perhaps Frontier Remake. I think it might look better.
    - This map was originally the next map after Chapter 6, but now there's an extra gap map.
    - The map is in the mountains northwest of the Chapter 6 map. The southeast corner is the starting position.


#### Palettes

These palettes were made by the original artists for FEGBA, the only thing I have done here is apply the palette to the tileset so it can be more easily used in Lex Talionis Engine.

Credits to BWDYeti for GBAFE Tileset Viewer which helped me to create these finished tilesets.

##### How I created these:
1. I took the palette and imported both it and the map config into FE Builder.
2. I saved the ROM as a new ROM, something like TEST CHAMBER or something.
3. I opened up BWDYeti's GBAFE Tileset Viewer and took a look at the final full compiled tileset.
4. I used "Print Screen" to copy the tileset into Aseprite and ensured the tileset meshed perfectly to the edge of standard tilesets.

##### Why did I create these?

Simply enough... FEGBA style "palettes" cannot be easily imported into Lex Talionis. I wanted to have the full tileset, but in each different palette so they can be used in Lex Talionis.

Most of the tilesets in the FE-Repo only contain one preview. If they contain a second preview, though, its often a map design rather than the tileset, making it not easily usable in LT. We need a full tileset with all tiles in each palette to be able to use them in LT.


##### List of Tileset Palettes
- Towns / Villages / Cities
    - Cynon's Metropolis
        - Made By: {Cynon}
        - I dropped in a Purple palette for 0.83 to coincide with the 0.94 Purple palette.
        - The other 3 tilesets were made by Cynon directly, I only included them here for completion.
    - Village - Remake + Coconut Tree + Ship Extras - Tileset
        - Made by: {flasuban, N426, ZoramineFae, Venno}
        - I created tileset versions of the remaining palettes:
            - Default Model 2, Night, Sunset, Snow
    - Village - Remaster + Well + Flowers + Alternative Houses - Tileset
        - Made by: {WAve}
        - I created the full tileset for "Night".
        - Additional Palettes:
            - Based on Village - Remaster - Coconut Tree + Mountains
            - Made by: {N426, ZoramineFae, Venno}
            - I created the full tilesets for the following palettes:
                - Snow, Snow Sunset, Sunset Model 1, Sunset Model 2, Green Knight, Purple White, Flashback
- Fields
    - FE6 - Fields - SnowyRemake - Tileset
        - Made by: {N426}
        - I created the full tileset for Sunset.
    - FE8 - Fields - Remaster - Super Fields - Tileset
        - Made by: {WAve, RandomWizard, Beast}
        - Aquamarine Roofs + Gray Mountains by: {Dark}, inspired by {LeifOClaude}
        - Autumn, Marsh, Verdant by: {Zarg}
        - I created the full tilesets for:
            - Aquamarine Roofs + Gray Mountains
            - FE7 Darker Water, FE7 Darker Green
            - Autumn, Marsh, Night, Purple, Yellow
        - Additional Palettes:
            - Based on FE7 Fields + Customs
            - Snow by: N426
            - Bright & Dark Field by: {MaxTheMagelord, WAve, RandomWizard, Beast}
            - Hallow by: {MaxTheMagelord}
            - Bright Green by: {Unknown}
                - NOTE: I cannot remember where this came from, nor can I find it in the Repo anymore. Was it removed? Dark Field appears to be the closest palette, so maybe it was renamed.
            - I created the full tilesets for the following palettes:
                - Bright Green, Hallow, Bright Field, Snow
- Caves
    - Lava Cave - Remaster - Tileset
        - Made by: {HyperGammaSpaces}
        -  I created the full tileset for FE7 Style


#### Autotiles

These autotiles were created by me. I created them from the original tilesets in the FE-Repo using the Map Animations that exist there, as such, I will be crediting the original artists for these map animations as well as the base tilesets.

- Additional Water Tiles
    - Original Tileset by: {Cynon}
    - Original Map Animations by: {Cynon}
    - These water tiles animations were part of Cynon's Metropolis, but they seem to work in a variety of different tilesets.
- Cynon's Metropolis
    - Original Tileset by: {Cynon}
    - Original Map Animations by: {Cynon}
    - I created autotiles for 0.8, 0.83, and 0.94.
    - The autotiles for the darker water do not work correctly, they are recolored blue instead. Perhaps in a future version these can be fixed. If you only use one color water (light or dark) in a single tilemap these should work.
    - The autotiles for the lanterns do not work correctly. Autotiles do not seem to work well with palette shift animations, as instead of working they simply fill out all animations with the same color.
- FE6 Fields - SnowyRemake
    - Original Tileset By: {N426}
    - Original Map Animations by: {N426}
    - Silvio from the LT Discord tried to get these working but was unable to figure it out. I went ahead and made them myself instead. Some of the tiles do not match exactly with the original sheet, I suspect this worked fine in FE Builder because the animation is directly chosen for each specific tile, but in LT they need to be replaced with the base tile in the tileset instead.

#### World Map

The World Map was designed by me. I originally had some rough ideas in my head for what I needed in specific locations.

1. I generated a bunch of fantasy world maps using [Donjon Fantasy World Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/world/) and found the one that best fit the idea I had in my head.
2. From there, I outlined the map's borders using a program I found online called AutoREALM, [available via SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/autorealm/).
3. This was my final World Map for years until I discovered [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/).
4. Using Inkarnate I made the final version of my map, using the original map design to mask out the continents as close as possible to my original design (https://inkarnate.com/m/P7eyDW), however its not fully fleshed out in detail.
5. Then I (converted it to a Parchment style)[https://inkarnate.com/m/Gzx2dK] to simplify the colors to make it easier to reduce colors and import into a romhack (which I abandoned).
5. Finally, I used tools to crop out the northern continents and added cities and other notable landmarks. [This is the version of the map I intend on using in the game.](https://inkarnate.com/m/mNbJE8)



### Portraits

All Portraits have been made by me without splices, as such, they're not necessarily the best.

My initial portraits started from AI generated portraits, then I retraced and reshaded them by hand to try and replicate the original design. From there, though, I started working on adding my own new additions to greatly expand and alter them.

All of my characters are of high fantasy races, with very few being insdistinguishable from real life humans or classical elves. As such, I have included generic elf or human variants of all my characters so people who want to use these portraits in standard games can do so, though I can't say I'm exactly happy with the ones I have so far.

The following characters I have portraits for so far:

* Princess Shayala Massione

  * This one was a complete accident. I was using Klokgen to come up with designs and I came up with a really nice design that suited her well.
  * When I traced the portrait, I tried to encompass her entire upper torso. Upon sharing it in the FE Graphics Repo this "style" was really well liked there. I have decided I want to use this "Bust" design for all my future character portraits.
  * Shayala is a Lykon, which are wolf-like elves. Her ears are furry on purpose. She has a tail but its not visible.

* Svetlanya Renald

  * Her name was originally Miriam. After seeing just HOW OFTEN the name Miriam is used in everything, I finally reluctantly decided to change her name. Not only have I seen Miriam in another FE romhack, but I also saw it in Unicorn Overlord, which is what really killed the idea of using the name.
  * Svetlanya is the main protagonist. Originally she was a supporting character to Relm, but when coming up with the idea for an FE fangame, I opted to instead make it a prequel with Svetlanya being the protagonist.
  * Svetlanya is a "Queiza", that being my take on Merfolk to a limited extent. Its more like a "water elf" where they have legs and fins, as well as a fin tail. Her ears are designed to reflect that.
  * Her "bust" pose has her complete final design. She has a more pink skintone (the skintone pulled from her original artwork) as well as a natural skintone from Blade's Skin Tones sheet. The pink version is intended to be her final design.

* Amaya Lyudam

  * Amaya is a former noblewoman and Svetlanya's new retainer.
  * I went through several variations of her, with some being Amaya already having known Svetlanya for some time. In the final draft, however, Amaya is only just being assigned to Svetlanya.
  * She is related to the Queiza, but is "degraded", which means she's lost her Queizan attributes. She cannot swim nor breath underwater, but she's still expected to follow Svetlanya wherever she goes...
  * Amaya is one of my oldest characters. Her name was originally just Maya, but after seeing just how many characters I had starting with the letter M I renamed her to "Amaya."
  * I was completely unhappy with the older portrait designs, I could never get the hair right. These designs will still be available to use.
  * The new bust-style design is a combination of the modern design drawn by my commission artist as well as her older armor design. The final portrait turned out very well IMO.

* Relm Kisaragi

  * Relm is the original main protagonist of the series.
  * When writing this story, I came up with the idea of it being a prequel. As such, Relm is now a teenager when normally she's a young woman.
  * Relm has many variant designs but I was aiming for a forlorn, sad expression on her face.
  * The Kimono is her intended final "main" outfit. Her starting design is intended to be a more messy look because she's been on the run for a long time.


Minor Characters:

* Frida Scenack

  * Frida was created to be a generic cleric, and her design is the intended "basic" design for generic clerics. She's a minor optional playable character now.
  * I originally created her to simply be a random cleric who speaks to Svetlanya in the opening. I had fun generating ideas for a cute Lykon cleric so I commissioned her design.
  * She is the wife of Urso. They're a young Lykon couple. The intent behind them is you can recruit either Frida or Urso initially, only able to recruit both of them later.
